Overview
In this assignment you will work in groups of 2 or 3 to implement a decision tree learning
algorithm and apply it to a synthetic dataset. You will also implement a pruning strategy in your
algorithm. You will be given labeled training data, from which you will generate a model. You
will be given labeled validation data, for which you will report your model's accuracy. You will
also be given unlabeled test data for which you will generate predictions.

I tried to perform pruning by using concept of reduced error pruning algorithm. I train my tree using the train data and keep the count of each node that has been traversed while executing that train data on my tree including leaf nodes. Then I used below algorithm to perform pruning:
Step 1: Use breadth first search to collect all nodes of the tree (excluding leaf nodes) in a list
Step 2: Traverse each node from list (from step 1), if all their nodes are leaf nodes then collect the number of times that leaf node is traversed (using the variable numberOfTimeTraversed).
Step 3: Sum all the count of traversal of each node (if their entire sub child is a leaf nodes).
Step 4: The leaf node with highest count is the famous child for that node.
Step 5: Take the backup of the node and replace the existing node with the famous leaf node.
Step 6: Measure the accuracy.
Step 7: If accuracy increased then continue from Step 1, else reverts the node with the original with the backup.
I choose this strategy because of the following reason:
1. This is bottom up approach and best way to replace a node using their famous child.
2. This is faster approach to prune a tree efficiently.
